I’d like to share my experiences and thoughts from my internship as a developer at Common Computer, which took place from June 30 to August 31, 2022.

Motivation for Applying
After completing my third year, second semester in university, I felt I had a solid grasp of fundamental CS knowledge (computer architecture, operating systems, networks, etc.)—though after joining the company, I realized I still had a long way to go. I wanted to get firsthand experience of what it's like to work in a company, so I looked into school-affiliated internship programs.

My priorities when choosing a company were:

Work I want to do: AI, back-end development, etc.

(Subjectively) a good company: based on friends’ reviews, business structure, related news

Location: Yangjae Citizen's Forest

Pay: a bit higher than others!

Based on these criteria, I applied to Common Computer, where I could gain hands-on experience deploying fine-tuned open-source AI models on their in-house platform. I was also drawn to the company’s focus on new business areas like metaverse, blockchain, and AI. They had already completed their Series B funding and operated platforms like AI Network, Ainize, and Afan, suggesting lots of opportunities to learn.

Although it took an hour by bus to get to the office, the option to work remotely made it manageable. (Remote work FTW!)
(+ The fact that there was no interview in the selection process also played a big role...)

What Does the Company Do?
Build a collaborative computing network to realize the internet of value.

That’s the company’s vision. If you ask me what it means… I’m not entirely sure either.

Still, if I had to explain: the term "value" in "internet of value" refers not to something “good” or “cool,” but to something that literally has value. This reflects one of the core shifts from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. To realize this, they’re developing services across various layers, such as a blockchain network (AI Network), cloud service (Ainize), and SNS service (Afan).

After hearing about all this, I realized how challenging starting a company really is.

Within AI Network, there are many subprojects like Baby-Shark NFT, Soul-Fiction, and Stradivarius. I wasn’t too familiar with this area, but if you're interested in blockchain, it might be worth checking out the AI Network DAO Discord server to see what projects are active.

What I Worked On
Initially, I was supposed to work on serving models on the Ainize platform. But I had a slightly stronger interest in back-end work, so after a discussion with my manager, I was assigned a task to detect malicious users who were mining cryptocurrency using the free GPU resources offered to all users on Ainize.

Since Ainize provides workspaces via Kubernetes and Docker, I started by studying the basics of those technologies. Then, I researched how to determine whether a workspace was being used for mining. (Detection logic omitted for security reasons.)

As most of the company’s work is done in Node.js, I had to learn JavaScript for the first time. I had experience with C, Java, and Python, so picking up basic JS syntax was fast—but learning code style, libraries, JSDoc, etc., took longer. Thankfully, thanks to my manager’s code reviews, I was able to learn in a week what would’ve otherwise taken much longer.

Outside of development, I also got to participate in workshops, OKR selection, and events like the Uncommon Gallery.

Company Culture
The company has a flat hierarchy where everyone uses the respectful suffix "님." Most meetings are remote-friendly thanks to the flexible work-from-home policy. Vacation days are easy to use—no need to feel guilty—and sick leave is available anytime (though the motto is “let’s not get sick”). Unfortunately, I was too healthy to use it. Overall, it’s a very free and relaxed culture.

Also, they provide a lunch budget of up to 15,000 KRW, so I enjoyed lots of great meals. Everyone at the company was kind and fun to be around, which made even in-office days enjoyable. Of course, commuting wasn’t fun. Since this was my first job, I don’t have much to compare it to, but I doubt many places have such a free-spirited culture.

What I Learned
Comparing the "me before joining" and "me now," I feel like I’ve changed a lot in a short time—not just in terms of development skills, but in various areas. I’ll summarize the key changes in three areas:

1. Collaboration and Project Management
   At school, even when using GitHub for team projects, it was mostly just a shared code folder. But at the company, I learned to use git branch methodologies like GitFlow, consider how to reduce dependency between functions, and think critically about division of labor—this really boosted my collaboration skills.

Everyone had their PRs reviewed before merging. This helped me develop habits like writing clearer, more intuitive code and thinking about how to explain my features effectively. Even a single line of feedback often saved me hours of trial and error.

In the past, I didn’t even know what PRs were, and I would merge freely without approval—earning myself a “GitHub YOLO” badge of shame. Now, I’ve learned to properly follow the PR-review process.

2. Communication Mindset
   I used to have few opportunities to talk with other developers, let alone pursue shared goals. So, my communication skills were underdeveloped.

Here, we had a one-week break every quarter to talk about current tasks and struggles—stepping back to realign our collective goals. I was only a week into the company at the time, so I didn’t say much, but listening to those discussions helped me understand how seriously the company values communication.

In our team’s weekly meetings, formal reporting is discouraged. Instead, we talk openly about progress, blockers, and improvements. We help each other through discussion and collective brainstorming. This made it easier for me to estimate timelines, organize my work, and improve time management. Even colleagues from unrelated projects took my problems seriously and offered helpful solutions, which accelerated my growth.

Through this, I realized that while communication might feel like a waste of time when you could be writing 100 lines of code, it actually prevents having to rewrite 1000.

3. Technical Growth
   Naturally, my development skills improved. I learned Node.js for the first time and studied asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await. It was confusing at first—like tangled earphones—but I’ve started to build mental models to understand it better.

I also wrote my first test code using the Jest framework, which taught me how essential testing is for maintainability. It helps other developers quickly understand the codebase, too. Just like checking your phone, wallet, and mask before leaving home prevents you from running back up the stairs, writing tests might be tedious at first but it saves you from climbing back up the call stack later.

In Conclusion
Actually, this isn’t the end. As you may have guessed from the tone of this reflection, I was very satisfied with my experience—and I’ve decided to stay until the end of the year. Two months flew by in a flash. Just as I was getting settled and confident, it was time to leave.

Writing all this out makes me realize how much I’ve grown—and I feel proud of that. If you’re like I was and are considering an internship, I highly recommend trying one. Nothing beats real-world experience.

For the next four months, I’ll be able to contribute fully without a ramp-up period. I don’t know what tasks I’ll be assigned, but I’m committed to giving back to the company that’s helped me grow so much.
